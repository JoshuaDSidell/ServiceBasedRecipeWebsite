A simple front end demo using HTML, CSS and JS for a mock up porfiolio for a private chef that offers services. The idea is to have everying centered, streamline and responsive between 1080p to 4k displays. 

The project took around 3 weeks to complete with 1 week put into making sure the webpage was mobile friendly. Works in FireFox, Safari and Chrome. The latter browser was used primarily during development. 

Flexbox, jquery, and animate on scroll (aos) were major tools for the overall look. and the JS is compiled with webpack and babel. Images pulled from Pexels free to use. 

There are still features I could impliment like user auth, and more refinsed drawers, but to keep things simple the current version should have no issue with other images or videos. 

---------------------

6/1 Version 0.3

*At this time future additions or revisions are TBD.  

The front end website is as complete as I'd want it. This version serves as a demo of how the website would look and function. It's more or less ready to be used less some backend features of the Account tab and different links/areas footer and services html.

Had to organize for npm installs and to work on server with babel and webpack. Project scaled down due to issue integrating API.
